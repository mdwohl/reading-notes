## Computer Architecture and Logic

The computer fundamentally helps us with thinking work -- it is a **thinking machine**.

It must:
* Take input
* Store information
* Process it
* Output results

The ancestor of the modern computer is a basic calculator.

*Input* makes the computer **do stuff**. Inputs give it info that is stored in memory. It is processed and sent until it is ready for output.

**Binary** -- Zeroes and ones -- represent information at its most fundamental, electrically. One wire can be **on** or **off**. That is, **yes** or **no**. Y or N is a **bit**, the smallest meaningful piece of information a computer can store. The binary system represents numbers in a fundamentally different way than the common decimal system.

Pixels represented by binary values by colors that make up images we see.

Circuits take signals, can combine, and give output results.
