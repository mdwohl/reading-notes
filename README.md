## Growth Mindset

A **growth mindset** is centered around the idea that capacities are not fixed at birth, that we are open books so to speak. We can continue to acquire new skills and knowledge throughout our lives. _Our minds are tools_ that can be improved and sharpened. This stands in contrast to a **fixed mindset**, in which the individual sees their own potential as inherent and limited -- impossible to increase or improve.

To keep myself centered in a **growth mindset**, here are some points to remember:
1. Challenges are opportunities. They enable us to learn new skills, but also to grow as individuals.
2. The __growth mindset__ is a way of seeing the world. It is not simply "_do x to learn y_".
3. Keep a dialogue with yourself. Ask questions. Each day, ask yourself "_what went well?_" and "_what didn't work as planned, and how can that be changed?_".

## **Choosing a Text Editor**

There are many different text editors available for programmers. What is less clear to many beginners is *how we go about choosing one*. The short answer is that the best text editor is the one that works best for *your* workflow. 

Quite simply:
- [x] Can it do the job?
- [x] Do you enjoy using it?

If you have checked both boxes, chances are you've found a good fit.

Whith that in mind, there are some features that most programmers agree make our jobs easier. A good text editor will often incorporate the following:

Feature | What it Does
------------ | -------------
Code completion | Suggests the code you're looking for to save time. Think of an autofill in a search bar or phone messaging.
Syntax highlighting | Different colors for different categories of code. Helps keep things organized.
Variety of themes | Helps reduce fatigue and keep you engaged visually & mentally.
Capacity for extensions | Allows you to customize to your needs.

Some examples are of popular text editors that include these features:
* Brackets
* VS Code
* Notepad++
* Atom

You can use a *"bare bones"* text editor, like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS. Though you can write code, they don't include many of these features that make your life easier as a programmer.

### The command line and terminal

When programming, you will be interacting with your OS in ways that may be unfamiliar at first. Your work will often emphasize entering a **command line** in a **terminal** rather than the GUI you're used to. It functions in many of the same ways, but without the slick visual aspects common to modern operating systems. This terminal interfaces with your OS via the **shell**.

>This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. - [Ryan Chadwick](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

Navigating the terminal takes some getting used to if you're new to it. Commands like **pwd** will locate you, and commands like **ls** and **-l** will list contents of directories. These will be expressed as *relative* or *absolute* paths. That is to say, in relationship to the **root** directory or to the specific directory you are currently working in. These paths describe relationships between different **files** and in Linux, everything is a file in terms of its function within the OS.

There are *many* other shortcuts and commands, but these are important to start knowing where we are in the terminal.
