## Growth Mindset

A **growth mindset** is centered around the idea that capacities are not fixed at birth, that we are open books so to speak. We can continue to acquire new skills and knowledge throughout our lives. _Our minds are tools_ that can be improved and sharpened. This stands in contrast to a **fixed mindset**, in which the individual sees their own potential as inherent and limited -- impossible to increase or improve.

To keep myself centered in a **growth mindset**, here are some points to remember:
1. Challenges are opportunities. They enable us to learn new skills, but also to grow as individuals.
2. The __growth mindset__ is a way of seeing the world. It is not simply "_do x to learn y_".
3. Keep a dialogue with yourself. Ask questions. Each day, ask yourself "_what went well?_" and "_what didn't work as planned, and how can that be changed?_".
